SETUP INSTRUCTION

To set up and install a web application locally from GitHub, follow this step-by-step guide. 
This will help you clone the repository, install necessary dependencies, and run the application on your local machine.

Prerequisites

Git: Make sure Git is installed on your machine. Install Git if you don't have it.
Node.js & npm/yarn: Ensure that Node.js and npm or yarn (for JavaScript/Node.js-based projects) are installed.
Download Node.js (npm is bundled with Node).
Optionally, you can install Yarn if the project uses it.

1. Clone the Repository from GitHub
To begin, clone the repository to your local machine using git.

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
Use the git clone command followed by the repository URL. Replace <repository-url> with the actual GitHub URL.
           
git clone https://github.com/bhavin0077/stress-away-meet-task.git

2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project directory:
cd stress-away-meet-task

3. Install Project Dependencies
Most applications have dependencies that need to be installed before they can be run. This is typically handled by npm or yarn.

Install Dependencies:
For npm:
npm install -f

For yarn:
yarn install -f

This command reads the package.json file and installs all the required dependencies listed in it.

4. Start the Application
Now, you're ready to run the application.

For npm:
npm start

For yarn:
yarn start
